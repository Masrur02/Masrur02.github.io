[Boundary-Aware Value Function Generation for Safe Stochastic Motion
Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14956) got accepted by the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR).
This work combines mesh-based and meshless function approximators to accelerate the computation of solving the second-order Hamilton-Jacobi Bellman (HJB)
equation while not sacrificing the strict boundary conditions on critical state dimensions.
