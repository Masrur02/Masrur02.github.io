## About Me

 I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree from the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University Bloomington, working with [Lantao Liu](https://luddy.indiana.edu/contact/profile/index.html?Lantao_Liu) in [Vehicle Autonomy and Intelligence
Lab](https://vail.sice.indiana.edu/).

  My research aims to enhance the spatial and semantic reasoning capabilities of autonomous robots by developing advanced vision-language models (VLMs). I focus on integrating natural language understanding with 3D semantic segmentation to enable robots to perceive, interpret, and interact with complex environments.
