## Academic & Intellectual Lineage

My academic lineage reflects a continuous intellectual tradition spanning robotics,
artificial intelligence, physiology, medicine, and the mathematical sciences.
Rather than representing genealogy, this lineage captures the transmission of
ideas, experimental methodology, and embodied reasoning that shape my work on
perception, affordances, and navigation in intelligent systems.

## Modern Robotics & AI Lineage

- **Lantao Liu** — PhD Advisor  
- **Dylan Shell** — Robotics, planning, and autonomy  
- **Maja Matarić** — Embodied and socially assistive robotics  
- **Rodney Brooks** — Behavior-based robotics and embodied AI

## Physiology, Medicine, and Natural Science Lineage

- Thomas Oriel Binford  
- Myron Lindsay Good  
- Henry Winston Newson  
- William Draper Harkins  
- Robert Eccles Swain  
- Lafayette Benedict Mendel  
- Russell Henry Chittenden  
- Wilhelm Friedrich Kühne  
- Rudolph Wagner  
- Johann Lukas Schönlein  
- Ignaz Döllinger  
- Antonio Scarpa  
- Giovan Battista Morgagni  
- Antonio Valsalva  
- Marcello Malpighi  

This lineage emphasizes structure–function relationships, experimental grounding,
and physical embodiment—principles that strongly inform my approach to robotics
and navigation.

## Mathematical & Physical Foundations

- Giovanni Alfonso Borelli  
- Benedetto Castelli  
- Galileo Galilei  
- Ostilio Ricci da Fermo  
- Niccolò Tartaglia (Autodidact-- Influenced by Al-Khwarizmi, Euclid)
-  

This intellectual foundation highlights geometry, mechanics, and abstraction,
which underpin modern spatial reasoning and navigation systems.
